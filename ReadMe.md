This is a small demo I worked on while learning Apache Tapestry.
I got involved with Tapestry because of some of the legacy code but found it really interesting.
I do not have much experience with FrontEnd but it seemed really intutive (ofcourse from a backend developer standpoint)
I wanted to build this in Go and Angular for personal use but this turned out to be far more simpler.
